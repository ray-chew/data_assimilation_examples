Some data assimilation examples I attempted.

- `Lorenz-63.ipynb` studies the effect of 
    * Extended Kalman Filter
    * Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) Filter
    * 4D-Var
  on a Lorenz-63 model.

- `Lax-Friedrichs-1D.ipynb` studies the effect of variational data assimilation on the Burgers' equation following [Chung et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/331697.332342)
  * I do not think the script is working.
